    			<h3>CONTENT: notes on this 3col Fixed assignment</h3>
    			<p>As in the 2 column exercise, the color change is detectible
    				where the div meets the .jpg background, I used the same
    				hexidecimal number in the PS doc as was used in the HTML?</p>
    			<p>The exercise uses a main wrapper background image as one
    				fixed strip, I get serious FLoat Drop when I resize (reduce) the
    				browser window. I think that is what "display:inline;/" stops IE
    				doubling margin on float" is for, but would like further
    				explaination to understand this comment.</p>
    			<p>Is keeping the #wrapper div necessary in a stylesheet if
    				there is also going to be seperate version wrappers as we have
    				here to contain the diffrent background images? Or perhaps this is
    				an example of an inner div as the book suggests? I am still
    				confused on that detail.</p>
    			<p>Even though I have auto margin sets on the wrapper div, the
    				page still huggs the left side? I've tired it in all of them, but
    				it won't budge?</p>

    			<p>Obviously, this footer has a mind of it's own...it's in the
    				wrapper, but the "clear" seems to be allowing it outside. However,
    				when I remove the clear, it hugs the bottom of the header?</p>
